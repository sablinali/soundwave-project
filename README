SOUNDWAVE 

Soundwave was a project to create a music app interface with React and Typescript. It is responsive either in a computer or mobile screen. The routes were done with React-Router-DOM and the styles were developed with Styled Components.

This app was developed with React Vite. To start, I ran $ npm create vite@latest

It has three pages (Homepage, DiscoverPage and JoinPage) and three components (NavTop, JoinButtom and Footer).
